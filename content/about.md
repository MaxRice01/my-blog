Hi, my name is Maxwell Rice. I am a data science major at the University of Arkansas and this is the blog for my final DASC 1104 project. This blog will be the home for my resume and final project, which is talking about two different datasets from the Tidy Tuesday repository (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
