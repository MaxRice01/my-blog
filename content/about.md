Hi, my name is Maxwell Rice. I am a data science major at the University of Arkansas. I have been interested in technology and the organization and application of data for as long as I can remember. I decided that I wanted to be a data science major last year. I had started my first year of college as a computer science major. After a little over one semester I found myself being a little disinterested with what I was studying. I felt felt like data science would be a much better fit for me, and so far I have been much more interested. This is the blog for my final DASC 1104 project. This blog will be the home for my resume and final project, which is talking about two different datasets from the Tidy Tuesday repository (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
