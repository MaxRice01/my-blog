<p>For my second dataset, I will be examining song genres vs song popularity. This dataset has 32,833 observations and uses 23 variables, and I will be using 4 of those variables. The first variable I will use is track_name, which lists the name of the song. The second variable I will use is track_artist which lists the name of the artist. The third variable I will use is track_popularity, which shows the score that it has received by spotify. The final variable I will use is playlist_genre, which shows what genre the song fits into.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Which genres have the most amount of songs that are very popular (85-100)?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>What is the overall popularity rating of each genre?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>In each genre, which artists are the most popular?</p>
</div>
