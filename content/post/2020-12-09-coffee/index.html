<p>For my first dataset, I will be examining the ratings of coffee beans being processed in various ways. The different ways that coffee beans can be processed are natural/dry, pulped natural/honey, semi-washed/semi-pulped, or washed/wet. This data consists of 1,339 observations and 43 variables, only 4 of which I will be using in my analysis. The first variable I will use is total_cup_points. This variable is the total score that the coffee receives out of 100. The second variable is processing_method, which states the method by which this coffee was processed. The third variable is country_of_origin. This variable states which country the coffee was produced in. The final variable I will be using is species, which shows the species of coffea.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>How does the rating differ between cups that were processed in one of the various ways?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>Which species of coffea produce the highest score with each method?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Which countries produce the highest rating using each producing method?</p>
</div>
