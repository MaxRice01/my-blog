      <description>For my first dataset, I will be examining the ratings of coffee beans being processed in various ways. The different ways that coffee beans can be processed are natural/dry, pulped natural/honey, semi-washed/semi-pulped, or washed/wet. This data consists of 1,339 observations and 43 variables, only 4 of which I will be using in my analysis. The first variable I will use is total_cup_points. This variable is the total score that the coffee receives out of 100.</description>

      <description>For my second dataset, I will be examining song genres vs song popularity. This dataset has 32,833 observations and uses 23 variables, and I will be using 4 of those variables. The first variable I will use is track_name, which lists the name of the song. The second variable I will use is track_artist which lists the name of the artist. The third variable I will use is track_popularity, which shows the score that it has received by spotify.</description>
