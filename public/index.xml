      <description>library(here) library(ggplot2) library(tidyverse) library(readxl) knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = TRUE, echo = TRUE) coffee &amp;lt;- read_csv(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tidytuesday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2020&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2020-07-07&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;coffee_ratings.csv&amp;quot;)) For my first dataset, I will be examining the ratings of coffee beans being processed in various ways. The different ways that coffee beans can be processed are natural/dry, pulped natural/honey, semi-washed/semi-pulped, or washed/wet. This data consists of 1,339 observations and 43 variables, only 4 of which I will be using in my analysis.</description>

This dataset has 32,833 observations and uses 23 variables, and I will be using 4 of those variables. The first variable I will use is track_name, which lists the name of the song. The second variable I will use is track_artist which lists the name of the artist.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Maxwell Rice. I am a data science major at the University of Arkansas. I have been interested in technology and the organization and application of data for as long as I can remember. I decided that I wanted to be a data science major last year. I had started my first year of college as a computer science major. After a little over one semester I found myself being a little disinterested with what I was studying.</description>
